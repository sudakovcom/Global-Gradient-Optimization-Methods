## Global Gradient Optimization Methods

This repository contains python implementation of algorithms for approach of finding global minimum of multidimensional functions.

### Summary

The proposed method explores a potential of applying global optimization along the line employing Moore-Skelboe algorithm for finding global minimum on whole set.  Proposed results compered to those achieved by vanilla Golden-section optimization.


### Testing:
We tested our approach on the following functions:

* `Rastrigin function` 
*  `Ackley function` 

Our model provides different optimization algorithms:

* `Coordinate descent` 
*  `Gradient descent`
